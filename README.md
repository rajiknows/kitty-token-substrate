# Substrate Kitties Pallet
This project implements a custom Substrate pallet for managing digital kitties, inspired by NFTs. Each kitty has unique DNA and can be owned, transferred, or sold within the blockchain. This pallet is built using Substrate and FRAME, leveraging the fungible token traits to manage balances and kitty ownership.

## Features
Kitty Creation: Generate a unique kitty with a DNA sequence and assign ownership.
Transfer: Transfer ownership of kitties between accounts.
Marketplace: Set a price for kitties and allow users to buy or sell them.
Ownership Management: Keep track of kitties owned by each account.
## Tech Stack
Substrate: A blockchain development framework.
FRAME: Used to build runtime modules (pallets).
## Example
Create a Kitty: Users can create their own unique kitties.
Transfer Kitties: Kitties can be transferred between users.
Buy & Sell: Set prices for your kitties and sell them on the blockchain.
